# Project Overview
This project analyzes modern Gen-Z slang usage across social media using a dataset of 535,396 records. The goal is to understand digital communication trends, slang categories, and contextual language behavior. Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed to handle inconsistencies and missing values. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to study slang frequency, popular terms, and category distribution. The project examines ironic usage patterns, sentiment behavior, and cultural expression in online conversations. Python libraries were used for data analysis, transformation, and visualization. Interactive dashboards were created to present insights through charts and trend analysis. The project demonstrates real-world data analytics, visualization, and data storytelling skills for large-scale textual datasets.

# KPI Question
1.What is the total number of slang records analyzed?

2.Which slang terms are used most frequently across social media?

3.Which slang category has the highest usage count?

4.What percentage of slang usage shows ironic meaning?

5.Which sentiment category (positive, negative, neutral) dominates slang usage?

# Process

I started the project by importing the Gen-Z slang social media dataset containing 535,396 records. The dataset included duplicate entries, but they were meaningful for analysis, so I retained them to preserve real usage frequency. Since the dataset did not contain any missing values, no missing data handling was required. I then organized and explored the data to understand slang frequency, category distribution, and overall usage trends. I analyzed sentiment categories and identified ironic usage patterns to study contextual language behavior. The analysis focused on understanding how different slang terms are used across social media conversations. KPIs were defined to measure slang popularity and engagement trends. Finally, I developed an interactive analytics dashboard to present insights and visualize modern communication patterns effectively.

# Project Insights
The analysis showed that a small group of slang terms dominates overall social media conversations. Certain slang categories appeared significantly more frequently, indicating strong trends in modern digital communication. I observed that ironic usage forms a noticeable portion of slang expression, showing how users often convey humor or sarcasm online. Sentiment analysis revealed that most slang usage falls under positive and casual communication rather than negative expression. High-frequency slang terms contributed heavily to overall engagement levels. The dataset also highlighted how Gen-Z language evolves rapidly through repeated usage patterns. Category-wise analysis helped identify popular communication styles used by online communities. Overall, the project demonstrates how data analytics can uncover cultural and behavioral trends from large-scale textual datasets.
